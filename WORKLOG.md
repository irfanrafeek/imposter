## 2026-07-14 — Hub tagline + multiplayer SEO terms (DONE)

Irfan wanted the hub tagline changed from "Free imposter online multiplayer
games" to "Trust no one. ;)" — a punchier, on-brand line. Since the old tagline
was the ONLY place "multiplayer" appeared in Google-indexed text (it existed
elsewhere only in JSON-LD `playMode` and body FAQs), added multiplayer keywords
to the high-value SEO surfaces so we don't lose that signal:
- **Hub / Dance / Word**: `meta description`, `meta keywords`, `og:description`,
  `twitter:description` all now include "multiplayer" once (natural placement)
  plus per-app multiplayer phrases in keywords (`multiplayer party game`,
  `multiplayer impostor game`, `multiplayer dance/word game`,
  `online multiplayer party game`).
- Titles left alone — already keyword-dense, adding more risks reading spammy.
- Version stamps bumped to v2026.07.14.3 on all three public pages.
- Verified in preview: multiplayer present in all four meta surfaces per page,
  hero renders the new tagline cleanly, Clarity snippet still in place.

## 2026-07-14 — Microsoft Clarity (heatmaps + session recording) (DONE)

Irfan wanted to see how audiences arrive and how they use the site. Added
Microsoft Clarity (free, unlimited) — project "Impostor Games", ID `xm6tsps1dc`.
- Snippet added high in `<head>` of the **three public pages**: hub, `/dance/`,
  `/word/`. **Skipped `stats.html`** deliberately — it's the owner-only `noindex`
  admin dashboard; tracking our own visits there would pollute audience data.
- Chose **no consent banner** (Irfan's call) — Clarity's standard snippet tracks
  immediately via first-party cookies. Departs from our cookie-free stance; noted
  that EU/GDPR traffic may later warrant switching to consent-gated mode
  (`clarity('consent')`, one-line change).
- Version stamps bumped to v2026.07.14.2 on all three pages.
- Verified in preview: tag `clarity.ms/tag/xm6tsps1dc → 200`, real tracker
  `scripts.clarity.ms/.../clarity.js → 200`, telemetry `POST j.clarity.ms/collect
  → 204`. Data confirmed flowing.
- Our own cookie-free aggregate analytics (sessions/rounds/categories/ratings/
  errors) stay in place; Clarity is additive, not a replacement.

## 2026-07-14 — Stats page: view selector + ratings/feedback (DONE)

Irfan wanted ratings/feedback exposed in stats + a per-app split. Shipped:
- **Both apps**: on emoji click in the feedback popup, additionally bump
  `analytics/${GAME}/fbprompt/ratings/${1..4}` (via existing bumpAnalytics). Same
  privacy model — just per-rating aggregate counters, no comments/text/PII. Full
  feedback records with text stay in `feedback/${GAME}` (`.read: false`) and are
  read from Firebase Console when Irfan wants them. Discussed both options —
  Irfan picked counters-only, leaving comments private.
- **stats.html restructured**:
  - Dropdown selector at top: Overview / Impostor Dance Game / Impostor Word
    Game. Only the picked section renders (`section.game.active` toggle). URL
    param `?view=music|word` preserved so refresh + share keep the choice.
    Default overview (no param).
  - Overview KPI split per Irfan: total app visits + **Dance games** +
    **Word games** as three separate cards (was one combined "Games" card).
    Second KPI row adds **Total ratings** (with avg score 0–4 and popup response
    rate %) + hub visits.
  - Per-app views get a third KPI card: Ratings (with same avg + response).
  - New Ratings panel (both overview and per-app): distribution rows 🤩/😄/😐/😕
    with counts + percent-of-total bars, plus header showing "N ratings · N
    dismissed". Empty state "No ratings yet." for pools with no data.
  - Footer note updated to explain what's included/excluded.
- Verified in preview end-to-end: seeded test ratings 3/5/18/22 into Firebase,
  confirmed overview and dance views both render distribution + avg (3.23/4) +
  response rate (48/51%), URL param + dropdown state persist across
  refresh, then removed the test node.
- Bug caught: my initial buildSections removed the combined `all-g-total` KPI
  but renderSection still tried to write to it → null textContent throw. Fixed
  by guarding those three assignments with element-exists check while keeping
  the combined games chart (which does still render for overview).
Dance v2026.07.14.1, word v2026.07.14.1.

## 2026-07-13 — Favicons + WebSite JSON-LD + PWA manifests (SERP polish) (DONE)

Google results for the site showed the generic globe icon — root cause: the site had NO favicon
at all (no link tags, no /favicon.ico — it 404'd). Also no WebSite JSON-LD, so results show the
bare domain instead of a branded "Impostor Games" site name. Shipped:
- **Icon family** in `www/icons/` (canvas compositing in the preview browser — no ImageMagick/PIL
  on this machine): brand set 16/32/48/96/180/192/512 + 512-maskable from a front-facing
  headphones-character artwork Irfan supplied in chat (1892² webp, recovered from the session
  transcript base64; small sizes crop to the central ~78–88% so the character reads, maskable
  uses the full frame as safe zone). Word-game set 180/192/512 + maskable from logo-word on cream
  `#FBF8F3`. All opaque so they never go invisible in dark UIs. Plus `/favicon.ico` (16+32+48
  PNG-in-ICO, built with a small Python struct script).
- **Link tags** on all three pages: favicon.ico + 48/96/192 PNGs (Google wants multiples of 48px),
  apple-touch-icon (word page gets its own), manifest link.
- **WebSite JSON-LD** added to the hub @graph (name "Impostor Games", alternateName imposter
  spelling) → lets Google show a branded site name in results. Organization logo now points at the
  square opaque icon-512 (better for logo rich results than the transparent logo.png, which stays
  as og:image).
- **PWA step 1 (manifest-only, NO service worker** — deliberately: a caching SW would fight the
  multiple-deploys-a-day flow): three manifests — hub (`/`), dance (`/dance/` scope), word
  (`/word/` scope, own icons). "Add to Home Screen" now yields a real app icon + splash +
  standalone full-screen instead of a glorified bookmark. Zero UI change, zero install push;
  Chrome may quietly offer "Install app" in its menu.
- **firebase.json**: `/icons/**` + `/favicon.ico` get `Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800`
  (immutable-ish assets shouldn't inherit the site-wide no-store).
- sitemap lastmod 2026-07-07 → 2026-07-13.
Verified in preview: all icon/manifest URLs 200 on all three pages, JSON-LD + manifests parse,
no console errors. NOTE: Google picks up the favicon on its own recrawl (days–2 weeks); Search
Console verification (Irfan's action) would let us request reindexing + see search queries.
All three pages → v2026.07.13.1.

## 2026-07-13 — Error telemetry (aggregate, cookie-free) (DONE)

Growth means bugs need to surface on their own — the "Could not load song" bug was only caught
because Irfan personally hit it in a live game; everything else fails silently. Added lightweight
aggregate error telemetry to **both apps**, reusing the existing analytics machinery
(`bumpAnalytics` + `safeKey`), so no new dependency, no cookies, no consent banner:
- **`trackError(label)`** helper → bumps `analytics/<GAME>/errors/<label>/count` plus a
  `errors/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<label>` breakdown (mirrors the games/daily pattern for spotting
  spikes). Stores a bucketed LABEL + count only — **never** a stack trace, URL, room code or user
  id (same privacy bar as the country/song counters). Throttled to ≤1 bump per label per 10s so a
  hot error loop can't spam Firebase or inflate counts.
- **Global handlers**: `window` `error` + `unhandledrejection` → any uncaught script/async failure
  gets bucketed. Resource 404s (message-less `error` events, e.g. a failed `<img>`) are skipped as
  noise.
- **Deliberate labels** at the known-fragile spots: dance `fbStartGame` catch →
  `song_load_failed` (the exact bug that started this); word `fbStartGame` catch →
  `round_start_failed`. Hand-labeled counters beat cryptic auto-messages.
- DB rules unchanged — `analytics/` is already `.read/.write: true`, so the new `errors/` subtree
  needs nothing.
E2E-verified in preview: dispatched synthetic `error` + `unhandledrejection` events → confirmed
`js: …/count:1`, `promise: …/count:1` and the `daily` breakdown landed in Firebase, then removed
the test node (`/analytics/music/errors` back to null). Both apps load with zero console errors;
module syntax checked. Dance v2026.07.12.6, word v2026.07.12.5.
NOTE: this is a pull, not a push — glance at `analytics/<GAME>/errors` occasionally. Natural
follow-up: a scheduled threshold alert if any error label spikes.

## 2026-07-12 — All pools validated + song-loading hardened (DONE)

Irfan hit "Could not load song previews" in a real game. Root causes: dead pool entries clog the
no-repeat unplayed list (they're never marked played) until <2 resolvable songs remain; iTunes
rate-limiting on burst lookups; plain network blips. Fixes:
- **Validated the 5 remaining categories** (sweep script): 80s 36/36, TikTok 39/39, 90s 39/39,
  Bollywood 40/40 clean. **Tamil had 7 dead + 1 wrong-match** ('Roja Janeman' → instrumental
  cover — served to real players 3× today per analytics). Fixed/corrected: Vaseegara,
  Singappenney, Naan Pizhai (movie was wrong), Manasilaayo (→Vettaiyan); added Katchi Sera,
  Aasa Kooda, Jalabulajangu, Chikitu, Monica, Golden Sparrow; dropped Roja/Mukkala/Bachelor-Don/
  Aaha Kalyanam (iTunes has covers only). Tamil now 42 validated. Bollywood: 'Kesariya' query
  fixed (was matching a random 'Druidess' track).
- **Preview cache**: successful lookups cached in localStorage 24h (short TTL on purpose — a
  rotted cached URL would silently break a round). Cuts iTunes traffic + rate-limit risk.
- **Auto-retry**: round start silently retries pickPair once before surfacing an error.
- **Friendlier failure**: "Couldn't load songs — check your connection and tap Start again".
- Also caught leftover "Three to eight friends" copy in both apps' How to Play (→ twenty).
E2E-verified in preview with a real room (bots injected): round started, both tracks resolved,
cache populated with exactly the picked pair. Test room + game noise cleaned/negligible (330 real
games today!). Dance v2026.07.12.5, word v2026.07.12.4.

## 2026-07-12 — Malayalam pool rebuilt: 60 validated songs, dance-heavy mix (DONE)

Expanded Malayalam from 40 → 60 entries — but the real fix: validating the old pool against the
iTunes Search API (the app's exact lookup: `entity=song&limit=5`, first result with a previewUrl
wins) showed **18 of 40 entries never resolved** (silently skipped by pickPair every round) and
one ('Vaathil Hridayam') matched a wrong song. Effective pool was ~21 songs. All 60 new entries
are script-validated end-to-end; several queries deliberately drop/change the movie name because
that's what surfaces the right master (e.g. Aluva Puzha is from Premam, Mukkathe Penne from Ennu
Ninte Moideen, Kattu Mooliyo from Ohm Shanthi Oshaana). Mix per Irfan: reels-trending + hits,
rebalanced to ~2:1 danceable-to-melodic (added Pistah, Avial ×3, Thaikkudam Bridge ×2,
Chingamaasam; cut the 7 slowest classics). Notable: 'Manavalan Thug' has NO iTunes preview in any
form — it was always dead and stays out. Covers/karaoke-only matches rejected on principle.
Validation scripts in session scratchpad; re-runnable pattern documented here. Dance v2026.07.12.4.

## 2026-07-12 — Player cap 8 → 20, now actually enforced (DONE)

`MAX_PLAYERS` was defined as 8 but **never referenced** — the cap was purely marketing copy; a
9th player could already join any room. Raised to 20 in both apps AND wired it into the join
flow: `joinRoom` and the code-box precheck now read the whole room, count players, and reject
with a "Room is full" toast (double-check guards the simultaneous-join race at 19/20). Both
prechecks order the guards consistently: not-found → in-progress → full. Updated every player-count
mention to 3–20 (28 spots: meta/og/twitter descriptions, JSON-LD maxValue, FAQs, on-page
definitions across hub/dance/word, plus llms.txt). The imposter stepper's existing scaling
(2 at 6+, 3 at 10+) now applies to big rooms. Live-tested: seeded a 20-player room, join as #21
→ "Room is full". Hub v2026.07.12.2, dance/word v2026.07.12.3.

## 2026-07-12 — PNG → WebP for in-app images (DONE)

Converted the three PNGs actually loaded in-app to WebP (cwebp -q 85 -alpha_q 100 -m 6, alpha
preserved) for faster loads: game-dance (127K→27K), game-word (124K→24K), logo-word (144K→26K)
— ~80% smaller each, no visible clarity loss (verified in preview). Updated `<img>` src in
www/index.html (both hub cards) and www/word/index.html (word logo); deleted the old PNGs.
**Kept logo.png as PNG** — it's used only as the og:image/twitter:image/JSON-LD share image,
never loaded in-app (no speed gain), and WebP og:images render unreliably across social/chat
platforms. Hub v2026.07.12.1, word v2026.07.12.2.

## 2026-07-12 — Round-milestone feedback popup (DONE, deployed)

Both apps now ask engaged players for feedback. Each device counts completed rounds in
localStorage (shared across dance + word — same origin). From the 20th round on, the Round Over
screen auto-opens a small popup (2s after the reveal so it never covers the payoff moment):
"Enjoying the game? 🎉" + one-tap emoji rating (😕😐😄🤩) + "Tell us what you think" link into the
existing feedback modal. It returns on later Round Overs until the player interacts once (rate /
open form / dismiss via ✕, backdrop, or Esc) — then never again on that device. Auto-closes
without burning the chance if the host starts the next round. Emoji ratings + form submissions
land in `feedback/<game>` with a `source` field (`landing` vs `rounds-milestone`); impressions
tracked at `analytics/<game>/fbprompt/{shown,rated,dismissed}`. Considered and rejected: gating
the host's Start on popup interaction (holds the group hostage to a feedback form). Test data
cleaned from live DB after verification. Dance v2026.07.12.1, word v2026.07.12.1.

## 2026-07-11 — Dance: persistent unmute overlay (DONE, deployed)

Browser autoplay policy can reject `play()` at round start; the old fallback was a 2.2s toast
("Tap anywhere to start audio") that was easy to miss — players sat in silence while the decorative
visualizer kept dancing. Replaced with a full-screen **audio-blocked overlay** (dark card, same
style as the reveal card, blurred backdrop): "🔇 Tap to start the music". It stays up until the
audio element's `playing` event fires; the tap re-seeks to the shared `startAt` offset, so a late
unmute still lands in sync. Safety-hidden in beginVoting / revealImposter / leaveRoom so it can't
linger past the round. Pre-unlock on Create/Join/Ready untouched. Dance v2026.07.11.1.

Discussed but parked: honest visualizer (animate only while actually playing), live 🔊/🔇 status
chip, audible "sound check" chime on I'm Ready.

## 2026-07-07 — Imposter Word Game + hub restructure (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal:** Add game #2 — the **Impostor Word Game** — and restructure the site into a hub.

### Decisions (confirmed with Irfan)
- **Structure (Option A):** hub landing at `/`, dance game moves to `/dance/`, word game at `/word/`.
  - SEO must not be compromised: the hub at `/` **keeps** the dance game's ranking content
    (title keywords, quotable definition, How to Play, FAQ, JSON-LD) and adds two game cards.
- **Word game rules:** each player gets a card — everyone sees the same secret word except the
  imposter, who sees "You're the Imposter" + a vague hint. Clue-giving/guessing is **all verbal**:
  no timer, no in-app voting, no in-app guessing. Host taps **"Reveal Imposter"** → every screen
  shows the imposter's name + the secret word → Play again (new word, new imposter).
- **Categories (6 × ~50 words, each word has an imposter hint):**
  Food · Animals · Places · Everyday Objects · Movies & TV · Football (soccer — players/clubs/terms).
- **Brand:** "Impostor Word Game" (o-spelling on screen, "imposter" e-variants kept in SEO keywords) —
  same convention as the dance game.
- **Tech:** self-contained `www/word/index.html` reusing the dance engine (lobby/QR/presence/idle
  cleanup, same visual style) minus all music/iTunes code. Rooms at `rooms-word/$code` (no
  collision with dance rooms). Analytics namespace `analytics/word`, feedback at `feedback/word`.
- **Process (standing):** create tickets per task and close them when done; keep this WORKLOG
  updated; best coding practices always.

### Plan / ticket list
1. ✅ WORKLOG.md set up (this entry)
2. ✅ Word content: 300 word+hint pairs (6 × 50, validated: no dups, all hints present)
3. ✅ Build `www/word/index.html` — dance engine reused; music/voting stripped; card screen +
   host Reveal; `rooms-word/$code`; `analytics/word` (games/words instead of games/songs)
4. ✅ Dance game moved to `www/dance/` (git mv) — SHARE_BASE → /dance, canonical/og → /dance/,
   absolute image paths, v2026.07.07.5
5. ✅ Hub at `www/index.html` — keeps dance SEO (title kw, definition, FAQ, JSON-LD with
   Organization + 2 VideoGames + FAQPage), two game cards, legacy `?join=` → /dance/ forward,
   `analytics/hub` visits
6. ✅ DB rules: `rooms-word` added (deployed to Firebase during testing)
7. ✅ SEO artifacts: sitemap (3 URLs), llms.txt rewritten for hub + both games; robots unchanged
8. ✅ Local test passed: full word round (create SFAB → 2 injected test players → start →
   imposter card w/ hint → Reveal shows name+word → Play Again → lobby); category modal bug
   found & fixed (CATEGORY_GROUPS key `items` → `categories`); hub render + join-forward OK;
   dance page OK at /dance/. Test rooms + test analytics (word/hub) deleted after.
9. ⏳ Deploy (firebase deploy --only hosting) + live verification — AWAITING IRFAN'S GO
   (DB rules already live; hosting deploy flips the site to hub structure)

### Post-batch polish (2026-07-08, all local, part of the same pending deploy)
- Hub redesigned to Irfan's mockup: big game illustrations (game-dance.png / game-word.png),
  dark Play pills, About divider before SEO content, version stamp tiny in footer.
  Cream `.art-frame` backdrop behind each illustration for visual weight.
- Both apps: "← All games" back-link on home, version stamp hidden (kept in DOM for feedback),
  home-fold bottom gap fixed (100dvh − 160px).
- Per-game logos: logo.webp → logo-dance.webp (git mv); new logo-word.png on /word/.
- Hub load-in stagger animation (pure CSS, prefers-reduced-motion safe).
- Word-game hints rewritten twice per Irfan: final style = 1–2 word attributes ("Pizza→Cheesy",
  "Messi→Magical"), hard mode — each fits several pool words, unique per category, no leaks.
- **Round Over reveal redesigned** (both apps): dark card with inline coral "IMPOSTER" pill +
  big serif name; track section (dance) / secret word (word) moved outside the card; "drumroll
  please…" subtitle removed. Play Again + Exit Room buttons kept.
- **Per-room no-repeat pool** (both apps): every round's picked song(s)/word written to
  `meta/played/<category>/<sanitizedKey>: true`. Next round filters the pool; when <2 unplayed
  remain (dance) or 0 (word), the category's played subtree is silently replaced with the fresh
  picks. Play Again preserves the played list; category swaps keep each pool's own history.
- **Ready state persists across rounds** (both apps): `fbReplay()` no longer clears
  `players/*/ready`. Players opt in once per session, toggle off manually if they need to step
  away. Fresh joins still default unready.
- **Stats dashboard extended**: stacked Impostor Dance / Impostor Word / Hub landing sections
  under one shared day-range selector; single `analytics/` read hydrates all three. Word section
  swaps "Top songs" for "Top words"; hub section is visits-only.
- End-to-end tested live (rooms H5D9 dance, 85TM word): 2 rounds each, played history + ready
  persistence verified via direct Firebase reads. Test rooms cleaned up.
- Versions after this batch: dance v2026.07.08.3, word v2026.07.08.3, hub v2026.07.07.3.

### Notes / watch-outs
- **Native app (Capacitor):** `www/` is the webDir, so the Android app will now open the hub.
  Fine (app = hub with both games), but revisit SHARE_BASE handling when the app is next built.
- Old QR codes / shared links point at `impostorgames.com/?join=CODE` → hub must forward these to
  `/dance/?join=CODE` (dance rooms are the only rooms that existed before the split).
- Two rounds of test analytics from the e2e verification are in the live DB (word ~2 games,
  dance ~2 games). Trivial; not worth clearing.

## Earlier context (pre-worklog summary)

- **2026-07-07:** Analytics split into clean `visits/` + `games/` subtrees under `analytics/music`
  (legacy keys cleared, fresh start). Cookie-free stats dashboard at `/stats.html` with a global
  day-range selector (7/14/30/90/All, default 30). AI-search visibility pack shipped: `llms.txt`,
  explicit AI-crawler robots.txt, quotable on-page definition, conversational FAQs.
- **2026-06-24 → 07-06:** Domain `impostorgames.com` connected (GoDaddy DNS), DB security rules
  version-controlled (`database.rules.json`), cookie-free analytics added, 15-min idle room
  cleanup, feedback form, share-code screen with QR join, SEO/rebrand to "Impostor Dance Game",
  Capacitor native-app groundwork (see NATIVE_APP_NOTES.md / ANDROID.md).
