## 2026-07-07 — Imposter Word Game + hub restructure (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal:** Add game #2 — the **Impostor Word Game** — and restructure the site into a hub.

### Decisions (confirmed with Irfan)
- **Structure (Option A):** hub landing at `/`, dance game moves to `/dance/`, word game at `/word/`.
  - SEO must not be compromised: the hub at `/` **keeps** the dance game's ranking content
    (title keywords, quotable definition, How to Play, FAQ, JSON-LD) and adds two game cards.
- **Word game rules:** each player gets a card — everyone sees the same secret word except the
  imposter, who sees "You're the Imposter" + a vague hint. Clue-giving/guessing is **all verbal**:
  no timer, no in-app voting, no in-app guessing. Host taps **"Reveal Imposter"** → every screen
  shows the imposter's name + the secret word → Play again (new word, new imposter).
- **Categories (6 × ~50 words, each word has an imposter hint):**
  Food · Animals · Places · Everyday Objects · Movies & TV · Football (soccer — players/clubs/terms).
- **Brand:** "Impostor Word Game" (o-spelling on screen, "imposter" e-variants kept in SEO keywords) —
  same convention as the dance game.
- **Tech:** self-contained `www/word/index.html` reusing the dance engine (lobby/QR/presence/idle
  cleanup, same visual style) minus all music/iTunes code. Rooms at `rooms-word/$code` (no
  collision with dance rooms). Analytics namespace `analytics/word`, feedback at `feedback/word`.
- **Process (standing):** create tickets per task and close them when done; keep this WORKLOG
  updated; best coding practices always.

### Plan / ticket list
1. ✅ WORKLOG.md set up (this entry)
2. ✅ Word content: 300 word+hint pairs (6 × 50, validated: no dups, all hints present)
3. ✅ Build `www/word/index.html` — dance engine reused; music/voting stripped; card screen +
   host Reveal; `rooms-word/$code`; `analytics/word` (games/words instead of games/songs)
4. ✅ Dance game moved to `www/dance/` (git mv) — SHARE_BASE → /dance, canonical/og → /dance/,
   absolute image paths, v2026.07.07.5
5. ✅ Hub at `www/index.html` — keeps dance SEO (title kw, definition, FAQ, JSON-LD with
   Organization + 2 VideoGames + FAQPage), two game cards, legacy `?join=` → /dance/ forward,
   `analytics/hub` visits
6. ✅ DB rules: `rooms-word` added (deployed to Firebase during testing)
7. ✅ SEO artifacts: sitemap (3 URLs), llms.txt rewritten for hub + both games; robots unchanged
8. ✅ Local test passed: full word round (create SFAB → 2 injected test players → start →
   imposter card w/ hint → Reveal shows name+word → Play Again → lobby); category modal bug
   found & fixed (CATEGORY_GROUPS key `items` → `categories`); hub render + join-forward OK;
   dance page OK at /dance/. Test rooms + test analytics (word/hub) deleted after.
9. ⏳ Deploy (firebase deploy --only hosting) + live verification — AWAITING IRFAN'S GO
   (DB rules already live; hosting deploy flips the site to hub structure)

### Notes / watch-outs
- **Native app (Capacitor):** `www/` is the webDir, so the Android app will now open the hub.
  Fine (app = hub with both games), but revisit SHARE_BASE handling when the app is next built.
- **stats.html:** currently shows only `analytics/music`. Extend later with word-game + hub data
  (separate ticket when needed).
- Old QR codes / shared links point at `impostorgames.com/?join=CODE` → hub must forward these to
  `/dance/?join=CODE` (dance rooms are the only rooms that existed before the split).

## Earlier context (pre-worklog summary)

- **2026-07-07:** Analytics split into clean `visits/` + `games/` subtrees under `analytics/music`
  (legacy keys cleared, fresh start). Cookie-free stats dashboard at `/stats.html` with a global
  day-range selector (7/14/30/90/All, default 30). AI-search visibility pack shipped: `llms.txt`,
  explicit AI-crawler robots.txt, quotable on-page definition, conversational FAQs.
- **2026-06-24 → 07-06:** Domain `impostorgames.com` connected (GoDaddy DNS), DB security rules
  version-controlled (`database.rules.json`), cookie-free analytics added, 15-min idle room
  cleanup, feedback form, share-code screen with QR join, SEO/rebrand to "Impostor Dance Game",
  Capacitor native-app groundwork (see NATIVE_APP_NOTES.md / ANDROID.md).
